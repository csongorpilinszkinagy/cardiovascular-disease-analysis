# Cardivascular disease (CVD) analysis

Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive method of measuring blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels, and it can also be used to calculate pulse rate. Recent studies have suggested that pulse oximeter data analysis can be used to predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) non-invasively. By analyzing the waveform data collected by a pulse oximeter, researchers have found that changes in the shape of the waveform can indicate early signs of CVDs such as arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction. In addition, pulse oximeter data can also provide information on heart rate variability, which is a strong predictor of CVDs. Therefore, the analysis of pulse oximeter data may offer a simple, cost-effective and non-invasive method for predicting the risk of CVDs in patients.
